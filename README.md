# HiVT: Hierarchical Vector Transformer for Multi-Agent Motion Prediction
Official Implementation of "HiVT: Hierarchical Vector Transformer for Multi-Agent Motion Prediction", which will be published in CVPR 2022.

Update:
2022/5/3: The official code is ready. Currently we are applying for a patent, so I'm not allowed to upload the preprint or the code. The code will be publicly available before July.
